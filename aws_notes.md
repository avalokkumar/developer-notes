### What are some different types of Routes available in AWS?

In Amazon Web Services (AWS), a route table is used to control the flow of network traffic within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or a subnet. 
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that specify where network traffic should be directed. 
There are several different types of routes that can be added to a route table, including:

* <b>Local route:</b> This is the default route that is automatically added to a route table. It directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to the local network interface.

* <b>Internet gateway route:</b> This route directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to the Internet gateway, allowing instances in the VPC or subnet to access the Internet.

* <b>Virtual private gateway route:</b> This route directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to a virtual private gateway, allowing instances in the VPC or subnet to access a VPN connection.

* <b>Peering connection route:</b> This route directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to a VPC peering connection, allowing instances in the VPC or subnet to access another VPC.

* <b>NAT gateway route:</b> This route directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to a NAT gateway, allowing instances in a private subnet to access the Internet while preserving their private IP addresses.

* <b>VPN connection route:</b> This route directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to a VPN connection, allowing instances in the VPC or subnet to access another network over a VPN.

* <b>Transit Gateway route:</b> This route directs all traffic for the VPC or subnet to a Transit Gateway, allowing instances in the VPC or subnet to access multiple VPCs and on-premises networks.

#### It is important to note that the traffic flow to each of these destinations, can be further fine-tuned via CIDR block, IP address or security group filtering
