### * IP Addressing: 
> IP addressing is a method of uniquely identifying devices on a network. There are two versions of IP addressing: IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses, and IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses. Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks, for example to increase network security or reduce network congestion. Private IP addresses are used on internal networks, while public IP addresses are used on the internet.

### * TCP/IP Model: 
> The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model is a framework used to describe how data is transmitted over a network. It consists of five layers: Application, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. Data flows from the top layer (Application) to the bottom layer (Physical), passing through each layer and receiving services from each layer along the way.

### * DNS: 
> The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system used to translate domain names into IP addresses. When a user types a URL into a web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to translate the domain name into an IP address. This IP address is then used to communicate with the server hosting the website.

### * Routing: 
> Routing is the process of forwarding data from one network to another. Routing is accomplished using routing protocols and routing tables, which determine the best path for data to take based on network conditions. The goal of routing is to find the most efficient path for data to travel from its source to its destination.

### * Network protocols: 
> Network protocols are standard rules for transmitting data over a network. Examples of common network protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Each protocol specifies how data should be formatted, transmitted, and processed at each end of the communication.

### * Network Security: 
> Network security is the practice of protecting a computer network from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. Common security threats include viruses, malware, and hackers. To protect networks, various technologies are used, such as firewalls, encryption, and virtual private networks (VPNs).

### * Network Architecture: 
> Network architecture refers to the design and configuration of a computer network. There are several types of network architecture, including client-server, peer-to-peer, and cloud computing. In a client-server network, one or more computers act as servers and provide services to other computers, which act as clients. In a peer-to-peer network, all computers have equal responsibilities and can act as both clients and servers. In a cloud computing network, resources and services are delivered over the internet from remote servers.

> ### * Cloud networking: 
Cloud networking refers to the networking technologies and services used to support cloud computing. It includes the physical and virtual networking components that connect cloud computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications. Cloud networking also includes the management and security of these resources, as well as the delivery of services to users over the internet.
