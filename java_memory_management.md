### Analyzing heap dump using JVisualVM

* First, you will need to generate a heap dump of your Java application. You can do this by using the jmap command line tool, which is included in the JDK. For example, you can use the command `jmap -dump:format=b,file=heapdump.bin pid` to generate a heap dump file called heapdump.bin for the process with the specified pid.

* Next, open jvisualvm and select the "File" menu and choose the option "Open Heap Dump". Then, navigate to the location of the heap dump file you generated earlier and open it.

* Once the heap dump is loaded, you can use the "Monitor" tab to see the overall memory usage of your application, including the heap size, used heap, and number of objects.

* The "Memory" tab provides more detailed information about the memory usage, including the distribution of objects by class and package. You can use this information to identify which classes are using the most memory and may be causing a memory leak.

* The "Sampler" tab allows you to take a sample of the heap and see the memory usage of specific threads. This can help you identify which threads are causing a memory leak and which objects they are holding onto.

* The "Profile" tab allows you to perform advanced analysis of the heap dump, such as identifying memory leaks, detecting memory allocation hot spots, and analyzing the performance of your application.

* Once you have identified the cause of the memory leak, you can use the information provided by jvisualvm to optimize your code and fix the leak.
