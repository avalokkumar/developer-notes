## Problem: Notification System

You are building a notification system that sends notifications via email, SMS, and push notifications to users based on their preferences. Each notification type has different formatting and delivery mechanisms. Design a solution that allows for easy addition of new notification types in the future. Which design pattern would you use? 
Explain your solution.

> **Note:** There can be multiple answers to this question. The important thing is to explain your reasoning.

### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
Explanation: The Strategy Pattern allows you to define a family of interchangeable algorithms (notification types) and make them easily replaceable. Create a strategy interface for notifications and concrete classes for each notification type.


The Strategy Pattern is another design pattern that can be used to solve the problem of sending notifications via email, SMS, and push notifications. The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

In the context of a notification system, the algorithm would be the `NotificationStrategy` interface. This interface would define the methods that all notification strategies must implement, such as send() and `getRecipient()`. The implementation of the notification strategy would be the EmailNotificationStrategy, SMSNotificationStrategy, and PushNotificationStrategy classes. These classes would inherit from the `NotificationStrategy` interface and would define the specific formatting and delivery mechanism for a particular notification type, such as email, SMS, or push notification.

The Strategy Pattern would allow us to easily add new notification types in the future. All we would need to do is create a new `NotificationStrategy` class that implements the `NotificationStrategy` interface. This new class would then be responsible for formatting and delivering notifications of the new type.

Here is a diagram of the Strategy Pattern applied to a notification system:
```
NotificationStrategy
    |- EmailNotificationStrategy
    |- SMSNotificationStrategy
    |- PushNotificationStrategy
```

The `NotificationStrategy` interface is the abstraction. The `EmailNotificationStrategy`, `SMSNotificationStrategy`, and `PushNotificationStrategy` classes are the implementations.

The Strategy Pattern is a good choice for this problem because it allows us to easily add new notification types in the future. All we need to do is create a new `NotificationStrategy` class that implements the `NotificationStrategy` interface. This new class would then be responsible for formatting and delivering notifications of the new type.

In addition, the Strategy Pattern makes it easy to change the notification strategy at runtime. This could be useful if we want to change the notification type based on the user's preferences or the event that is being notified.


### Design Pattern: Bridge Pattern

#### Explanation: 
The Bridge Pattern is a design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation. This allows for the two to vary independently, making it easy to add new implementations without affecting the abstraction.

In the context of a notification system, the abstraction would be the `Notification` interface. This interface would define the methods that all notifications must implement, such as send() and `getRecipient()`. The implementation of the notification would be the `NotificationType` class. This class would inherit from the `Notification` interface and would define the specific formatting and delivery mechanism for a particular notification type, such as email, SMS, or push notification.

The Bridge Pattern would allow us to easily add new notification types in the future. All we would need to do is create a new NotificationType class that implements the ``Notification`` interface. This new class would then be responsible for formatting and delivering notifications of the new type.

Here is a diagram of the Bridge Pattern applied to a notification system:
```
`Notification`
    |- EmailNotification
    |- SMSNotification
    |- PushNotification
```

The `Notification` interface is the abstraction. The EmailNotification, SMSNotification, and PushNotification classes are the implementations.

This design pattern allows us to easily add new notification types in the future. All we need to do is create a new NotificationType class that implements the `Notification` interface. This new class would then be responsible for formatting and delivering notifications of the new type.

## Problem: Online Shopping Cart
You are developing an online shopping platform. Users can add items to their cart, and the cart should calculate the total price, apply discounts, and handle shipping options. The pricing rules and discount strategies may vary over time.
Which design pattern would you use to implement the shopping cart? Explain your solution.

### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
### Explanation: 
The Strategy Pattern enables you to define different algorithms for calculating prices and applying discounts. Create strategies for different pricing rules and discounts, allowing the cart to switch between them based on user selections.


The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

In the context of an online shopping cart, the algorithm would be the PricingStrategy interface. This interface would define the methods that all pricing strategies must implement, such as `calculateTotal()` and `applyDiscounts()`. The implementation of the pricing strategy would be the `FixedPriceStrategy`, `PercentageDiscountStrategy`, and `FreeShippingStrategy` classes. These classes would inherit from the `PricingStrategy` interface and would define the specific pricing rules and discount strategies for a particular type of shopping cart, such as a fixed price shopping cart, a percentage discount shopping cart, or a free shipping shopping cart.

The Strategy Pattern would allow us to easily change the pricing strategy of the shopping cart without having to change the code that interacts with the shopping cart. This is because the pricing strategy is encapsulated in a separate object that can be swapped out at runtime.

For example, we could create a `FixedPriceStrategy` class that calculates the total price of the shopping cart based on the fixed price of each item. We could also create a `PercentageDiscountStrategy` class that calculates the total price of the shopping cart by applying a percentage discount to the original price.

The shopping cart would then be able to use either of these pricing strategies, depending on the user's preferences.

Here is a diagram of the Strategy Pattern applied to an online shopping cart:

```
PricingStrategy
    |- FixedPriceStrategy
    |- PercentageDiscountStrategy
    |- FreeShippingStrategy
```

The PricingStrategy interface is the abstraction. The `FixedPriceStrategy`, `PercentageDiscountStrategy`, and `FreeShippingStrategy` classes are the implementations.

This design pattern allows us to easily change the pricing strategy of the shopping cart without having to change the code that interacts with the shopping cart. This is because the pricing strategy is encapsulated in a separate object that can be swapped out at runtime.

In addition, the Strategy Pattern makes it easy to add new pricing strategies to the shopping cart in the future. All we need to do is create a new PricingStrategy class that implements the PricingStrategy interface. This new class would then be responsible for calculating the total price of the shopping cart according to the new pricing rules.


### Other design patterns that could be used to implement an online shopping cart:

### Observer Pattern: 
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern could be used to implement the shopping cart in a way that allows users to be notified when the total price of their cart changes, or when new items are added or removed from the cart.

### State Pattern: 
The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern could be used to implement the shopping cart in a way that allows users to change the pricing strategy of the cart at runtime. For example, a user could start out with a fixed price pricing strategy, but then switch to a percentage discount pricing strategy if they spend a certain amount of money.

### Factory Method Pattern: 
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating objects, but leaves the actual implementation of those objects to subclasses. This pattern could be used to implement the shopping cart in a way that allows different types of shopping carts to be created at runtime, such as a fixed price shopping cart, a percentage discount shopping cart, or a free shipping shopping cart.

## Problem: Authentication System
You are building an authentication system that supports multiple authentication methods like username-password, social media logins, and biometric authentication. The system should be easily extensible to add new authentication methods.
Which design pattern would you use to implement the authentication system? Explain your solution.


### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

In the context of an authentication system, the algorithm would be the `AuthenticationStrategy` interface. This interface would define the methods that all authentication strategies must implement, such as authenticate(). The implementation of the authentication strategy would be the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy`, `SocialMediaLoginStrategy`, and `BiometricAuthenticationStrategy` classes. These classes would inherit from the `AuthenticationStrategy` interface and would define the specific authentication logic for a particular authentication method, such as username-password authentication, social media login, or biometric authentication.

The Strategy Pattern would allow us to easily add new authentication methods to the authentication system without having to change the code that interacts with the authentication system. This is because the authentication strategy is encapsulated in a separate object that can be swapped out at runtime.

For example, we could create a `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy` class that authenticates users using username and password credentials. We could also create a `SocialMediaLoginStrategy` class that authenticates users using their social media credentials.

The authentication system would then be able to use either of these authentication strategies, depending on the user's preferences.

Here is a diagram of the Strategy Pattern applied to an authentication system:
```
AuthenticationStrategy
    |- UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy
    |- SocialMediaLoginStrategy
    |- BiometricAuthenticationStrategy
```

The `AuthenticationStrategy` interface is the abstraction. The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy`, `SocialMediaLoginStrategy`, and `BiometricAuthenticationStrategy` classes are the implementations.

This design pattern allows us to easily add new authentication methods to the authentication system without having to change the code that interacts with the authentication system. This is because the authentication strategy is encapsulated in a separate object that can be swapped out at runtime.

In addition, the Strategy Pattern makes it easy to change the authentication strategy at runtime. This could be useful if we want to change the authentication method based on the user's preferences or the security requirements of the system.


### Design Pattern: Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines a factory method that is responsible for creating objects of a particular type. This allows the client code to be decoupled from the concrete implementation of the objects that it creates.

In the context of an authentication system, the factory method would be the `AuthenticationFactory` class. This class would have a method called `createAuthenticationStrategy()` that would return an object of the appropriate `AuthenticationStrategy` subclass, depending on the authentication method that is requested.

For example, if the user requests a username-password authentication, the `AuthenticationFactory` class would return an instance of the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy` class. If the user requests a social media login, the `AuthenticationFactory` class would return an instance of the `SocialMediaLoginStrategy` class.

The Factory Method Pattern would allow us to easily add new authentication methods to the authentication system without having to change the code that interacts with the authentication system. This is because the factory method is responsible for creating the objects, and the client code only needs to know the name of the authentication method that it wants to use.

Here is a diagram of the Factory Method Pattern applied to an authentication system:
```
AuthenticationFactory
    createAuthenticationStrategy()
```

```
AuthenticationStrategy
    |- UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy
    |- SocialMediaLoginStrategy
    |- BiometricAuthenticationStrategy
```

The `AuthenticationFactory` class is the factory. The `AuthenticationStrategy` interface is the abstraction. The `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationStrategy`, `SocialMediaLoginStrategy`, and `BiometricAuthenticationStrategy` classes are the implementations.

This design pattern allows us to easily add new authentication methods to the authentication system without having to change the code that interacts with the authentication system. This is because the factory method is responsible for creating the objects, and the client code only needs to know the name of the authentication method that it wants to use.

In addition, the Factory Method Pattern makes it easy to change the authentication method at runtime. This could be useful if we want to change the authentication method based on the user's preferences or the security requirements of the system.

## Problem: File System

Which design pattern would you use to implement a file system that supports multiple file types like text files, image files, and video files? Explain your solution.

### Design Pattern: Composite Pattern

### Explanation:

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It is particularly suitable for modeling hierarchical structures like file systems.

For implementing a file system that supports multiple file types like text files, image files, and video files, the Composite Pattern can be used effectively. Here's how the pattern can be applied to this problem:

#### 1. Component:
Define an abstract component class that represents the common interface for all file types. This class will have methods to perform operations like opening, reading, and writing files. This can be an interface or an abstract class.

#### 2. Leaf:
Implement concrete leaf classes for different file types (e.g., TextFile, ImageFile, VideoFile) that extend the component class. These classes will provide specific implementations for opening, reading, and writing their respective file types.

#### 3. Composite:
Create a composite class (e.g., Folder) that also extends the component class. This class will represent folders in the file system. It can hold a collection of child components, which can be either files or other folders. The composite class will provide methods for adding and removing child components.

### Advantages of Using the Composite Pattern:

#### 1. Flexibility: 
The Composite Pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This means you can work with both individual files and folders in a consistent manner.

#### 2. Nested Structures: 
The pattern supports creating nested structures, making it suitable for representing hierarchical relationships like file systems with folders containing files.

#### 3. Ease of Adding New Types: 
Adding new file types is straightforward. You can create new leaf classes that implement the component interface and add them to the composite structure.

#### 4. Code Reusability: 
By defining common operations in the component interface, you ensure that these operations can be reused across different file types.

#### 5. Client-Server Transparency: 
Clients can treat individual files and folders in the same way. This simplifies the client code as it doesn't need to distinguish between the two.

### Example Usage:

Let's say you have a Folder object representing the root directory of your file system. Inside this folder, you can have instances of TextFile, ImageFile, and other Folder objects. The composite structure allows you to create nested folders, organize files, and perform operations on them uniformly.
```java
interface FileComponent {
    void open();
    void read();
    void write();
}

class TextFile implements FileComponent { /* ... */ }
class ImageFile implements FileComponent { /* ... */ }
class VideoFile implements FileComponent { /* ... */ }

class Folder implements FileComponent {
    private List<FileComponent> children = new ArrayList<>();

    void add(FileComponent fileComponent) { /* ... */ }
    void remove(FileComponent fileComponent) { /* ... */ }

    @Override
    public void open() { /* ... */ }

    @Override
    public void read() { /* ... */ }

    @Override
    public void write() { /* ... */ }
}
```

By using the Composite Pattern, you can create a flexible and extensible file system that supports multiple file types and maintains a hierarchical structure. This pattern ensures that clients can work with individual files and folders seamlessly, making it a suitable choice for building file systems

### Other design patterns that could be used to implement a file system:

#### 1. Adapter Pattern:
The Adapter Pattern allows you to adapt the interface of one class to match the requirements of another. This pattern could be used to implement a file system that supports multiple file types by adapting the interface of each file type to match the requirements of the file system.

#### 2. Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator Pattern allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. This pattern could be used to implement a file system that supports multiple file types by decorating each file type with additional functionality.

#### 3. Proxy Pattern:
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern could be used to implement a file system that supports multiple file types by using a proxy object to control access to each file type.

## Problem: Logging System
You need to implement a logging system that records different types of log messages (info, warning, error) to different destinations (console, file, database). The system should be flexible to add new log destinations.

### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern

### Explanation:

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm in a separate class, and makes these classes interchangeable. It allows a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime.

For implementing a logging system that records different types of log messages to different destinations, the Strategy Pattern can be used effectively. Here's how the pattern can be applied to this problem:

#### 1. Context:
Define a context class that holds a reference to the current log strategy. This class provides methods for setting the log strategy and triggering log messages.

#### 2. Strategy:
Create an interface or an abstract class for the log strategy. This interface should declare methods like logInfo, logWarning, and logError that encapsulate the different types of log messages. Each strategy class (e.g., ConsoleLogStrategy, FileLogStrategy, DatabaseLogStrategy) will implement these methods based on the specific destination.

#### 3. Concrete Strategies:
Implement concrete strategy classes for different log destinations. Each concrete strategy class will provide its own implementation for writing log messages to the respective destination (console, file, database).

### Advantages of Using the Strategy Pattern:

#### 1. Flexibility: 
The Strategy Pattern allows you to change the behavior of the logging system at runtime by swapping different log strategies. You can add new log strategies without modifying the existing code.

#### 2. Separation of Concerns: 
By encapsulating each log strategy in its own class, you achieve better separation of concerns. Changes in one log strategy won't affect others.

#### 3. Easy Extensibility: 
Adding new log destinations (e.g., sending logs to a remote server) is straightforward. You can create new strategy classes that implement the log strategy interface.

#### 4. Code Reusability: 
Similar to the previous point, if certain behaviors (e.g., logging error messages) are common across strategies, you can reuse code within the respective strategy classes.

#### 5. Testability: 
The Strategy Pattern facilitates testing, as you can create mock implementations of the log strategy interface for unit testing.

### Example Usage:

Let's say you have a Logger class that acts as the context for the strategy pattern. Clients can set the log strategy (e.g., ConsoleLogStrategy, FileLogStrategy) and trigger different types of log messages using the chosen strategy.
```java
interface LogStrategy {
    void logInfo(String message);
    void logWarning(String message);
    void logError(String message);
}

class ConsoleLogStrategy implements LogStrategy { /* ... */ }
class FileLogStrategy implements LogStrategy { /* ... */ }
class DatabaseLogStrategy implements LogStrategy { /* ... */ }

class Logger {
    private LogStrategy logStrategy;

    void setLogStrategy(LogStrategy logStrategy) { /* ... */ }
    void logInfo(String message) { /* ... */ }
    void logWarning(String message) { /* ... */ }
    void logError(String message) { /* ... */ }
}
```

By using the Strategy Pattern, you can implement a flexible logging system that supports different log destinations (console, file, database) and handles various types of log messages (info, warning, error). This pattern allows you to change the logging behavior dynamically and facilitates the addition of new log strategies in the future.

### Other design patterns that could be used to implement a logging system:

#### 1. Observer Pattern:
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern could be used to implement a logging system that notifies clients when new log messages are added.

#### 2. Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator Pattern allows you to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. This pattern could be used to implement a logging system that adds additional functionality (e.g., timestamping) to log messages.

#### 3. Proxy Pattern:
The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern could be used to implement a logging system that controls access to log messages (e.g., only allowing certain users to view error logs).

## Problem: Object Persistence
You are working on a system that needs to persist objects to different data sources like databases, files, and external services. The persistence mechanisms might change over time.

### Design Pattern: Adapter Pattern
### Explanation: 
The Adapter Pattern allows you to adapt the interface of one class to match the requirements of another. Create adapters for each data source to translate your application's data structure into the format expected by each data source. This keeps the persistence logic separate from the main application logic.

## Problem: GUI Component Library
You are developing a GUI component library where users can create different types of UI elements like buttons, checkboxes, and text fields. Each component might have different properties and behaviors.

### Design Pattern: Builder Pattern
### Explanation: 
The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. Create builder classes for each type of UI component that handle the creation and configuration of components. This allows users to create components with specific properties without exposing all the details.

## Problem: Undo/Redo Functionality
You want to implement undo and redo functionality for an application where users perform various actions. The system should allow users to undo and redo actions in a seamless manner.

### Design Pattern: Command Pattern
### Explanation: 
The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize objects with operations. Implement command objects that represent user actions. Maintain a stack for undo and redo operations, executing the appropriate command when needed.

## Problem: Streaming Service Recommendations
You are building a streaming service that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. The recommendation algorithms might change or evolve over time.

### Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern
### Explanation: 
The Strategy Pattern allows you to encapsulate different recommendation algorithms. Create strategy classes for each recommendation algorithm, and switch between them based on user preferences. This makes it easier to experiment with and update recommendation strategies.
